    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>1. How do I pause my keyboard?</strong><br />
        In KeysCleaner’s main window, select your preferred duration and click "Start". Your keyboard will be blocked for the chosen time. To stop early, simply click the "Stop" button.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>2. Can I stop the blocking before the timer ends?</strong><br />
        Yes. Click the "Stop" button at any time and your keyboard will be re-enabled immediately.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>3. Do I need special permissions?</strong><br />
        KeysCleaner requires Accessibility permissions to temporarily block your keyboard input. The app will prompt you to grant these permissions in System Settings if you haven’t done so already.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>4. Is any data collected or sent to servers?</strong><br />
        No. KeysCleaner does not collect, store, or transmit personal data. Everything happens locally on your device.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>5. Will KeysCleaner work with external keyboards?</strong><br />
        KeysCleaner is designed to block the keyboard events at a system level. Most external keyboards connected to your Mac will also be blocked during the set duration.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>6. How do I know when the timer is finished?</strong><br />
        When the timer counts down to zero, keyboard input is automatically restored, and the app will display "Keyboard is active" to indicate that normal typing can resume.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>7. Can I customize the available durations?</strong><br />
        Currently, KeysCleaner offers predefined intervals (e.g., 15s, 30s, 1m). Future updates may include additional customization options.
      </li>
    </ul>
