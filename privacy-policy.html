    <h1>KeysCleaner - Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated: December 17, 2024</strong></p>

    <p>
      At <strong>KeysCleaner</strong> ("we", "us", or "our"), we respect and prioritize
      your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how our macOS application,
      <strong>KeysCleaner</strong>, handles information related to its usage and features.
      By using <strong>KeysCleaner</strong>, you agree to the terms and practices described here.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Access</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>KeysCleaner</strong> does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or 
      identifying information. The application operates locally on your device and 
      does not require access to your personal data, files, or network activity.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Device’s Input</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>KeysCleaner</strong> temporarily disables keyboard input for a selected 
      duration to allow you to clean your keyboard without triggering unwanted 
      keystrokes. This functionality is performed locally on your machine and 
      does not involve sending any data to external servers or third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Collection, Sharing, and Disclosure</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>KeysCleaner</strong> does not collect or share any information about your 
      usage, input events, or other personal details. Since no data is gathered, 
      there is nothing to disclose to third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <p>
      Because <strong>KeysCleaner</strong> does not store any user data, you do not need to 
      worry about data security within the application. All processes occur 
      within the confines of your local macOS environment, benefiting from the 
      device’s inherent security measures.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>KeysCleaner</strong> does not integrate with, rely on, or communicate with any 
      third-party services. The app runs entirely on your device and no external 
      calls are made.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>KeysCleaner</strong> is not targeted at children and does not collect any data, 
      including from children under the age of 13. Without data collection, the app 
      poses no risk to child privacy.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in 
      our practices or legal obligations. Any changes will be posted here with 
      an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.
    </p>
